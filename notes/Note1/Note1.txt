TO-DO list 5/1/25 

having fun making sprites for the time being
but there is still A LOT to get done before I can be confident in this title! 
I wont go into everything here, but I will say what the next session of coding should entail: 

--Add all costumes to be viewable somehow (Debug mode) 
--Add a global coin tally system that tracks ALL the coins you earn and spend 
--Add a proper results screen that displays info 
--Have said results screen calculate how many coins you have earned via running 
was thinking making it like for every 12 score points you get 1 coin. Should round down
--Create shorter ranges for when the game increases speed, making objects spawn more frequently 

prob wont be able to do all of these, but lets try our best! 

TO-DO List 5/7/25 

We did alot today! Got the ground moving, fixed up the menus functioinality, Added another costume and polish.
Seems like the next thing Jam wants to tackle is the pause menu, which I'm down for! Pausing is important 
Things I want the pause menu to have are:
	-Pausing all gameplay assets (duh) 
	-Having a countdown from 3 upon unpausing 
	-the ability to Resume, Options, and Quit
I will make sure to add new sprites for the other menu assets soon!
