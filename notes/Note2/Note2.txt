Right now I am working on sprites and updating some assets while trying to add stuff. 
I want to 
	-Add effect for when coins are collected 
	-Put characters in idle on results screen
	-Add new menu buttons to look nicer 
	-maybe add a title screen and some logos 


---Coin effect----
I seem to have gotten the coin effect to work but with some hiccups... 
Now youre collecting the coin for every frame and upon first collecting the first coin the player uses the effect...
tried doing 
if global.CoinCount >= 1 
{
	sprite_index = Coin_Collected; 
	instance_destroy(other)
}
cuz I need the coin to react ot being collected, I also tried putting it in the oCoin collision event with the player 
that brought up errors of its own.
I have reverted all changes to what they were beforehand 

working with Jampley and we are making a new object for the effect! 
we created "oCollected" using the aniamtion end event and adding a new line to the oPlayer coin collision event 
this line makes the effect play where the coin was collected 


---Results screen stuff---
I also tried to make the player idle on the results screen, but he continued to fall into the endless void 
heres what I tried putting in the "results" state 

if room_exists(RoomResults) //use if room = room_name to ask if youre in a specific room 
		{
			HasControl = false; 
			grav = 0; 
			FallSpeed = 0; 
			onground = true
			sprite_index =  global.SpriteList[global.CurrentSprite].IdleSprite; 
		}
didnt seem to do anything. Maybe I can just put a floor there and he will stand? 
gtg for now, other sprites and details added are in the commit on GitHub

today Imma have Bynary help me make some shaders for my character! we shall see how it goes...
after messing around with it, not too much I must admit, IDK if this is what I wanna do. 
I think if I try more I might get the proper result, but it feels a bit complicated to me...Maybe I just need more practice? 
Like, I have alot of basic color sprites I wanna add just to give the player stuff to buy even if its not that interesting,
but I feel it would be faster if I made each sprite palette myself instead of looking for each individual color. Should chat about it again.

rn Im doing very small things, but adding a ton of music I want the game to use one way or another! I am also currently working on 3 more costumes for the game.
This is way more than I intended, but some people were just interested so IG I have to do them now cuz it will be AWESOME to celebrate my friends games. 
No more after this tho, these are taking WAAAAAAAY longer than intended. 

Today we are going to try and improve the spawn rate of all the objects when the game increases speed, and we seem to have made a good result. 
There are comments to tell you where to change numbers if you wanna balance stuff out a bit more 
Next I will want to add a "DEV_MODE" that displays a ton of info and makes testing easier, as the final game wont play exactly the same.
