Right now I am working on sprites and updating some assets while trying to add stuff. 
I want to 
	-Add effect for when coins are collected 
	-Put characters in idle on results screen
	-Add new menu buttons to look nicer 
	-maybe add a title screen and some logos 


---Coin effect----
I seem to have gotten the coin effect to work but with some hiccups... 
Now youre collecting the coin for every frame and upon first collecting the first coin the player uses the effect...
tried doing 
if global.CoinCount >= 1 
{
	sprite_index = Coin_Collected; 
	instance_destroy(other)
}
cuz I need the coin to react ot being collected, I also tried putting it in the oCoin collision event with the player 
that brought up errors of its own.
I have reverted all changes to what they were beforehand 

working with Jampley and we are making a new object for the effect! 
we created "oCollected" using the aniamtion end event and adding a new line to the oPlayer coin collision event 
this line makes the effect play where the coin was collected 


---Results screen stuff---
I also tried to make the player idle on the results screen, but he continued to fall into the endless void 
heres what I tried putting in the "results" state 

if room_exists(RoomResults) //use if room = room_name to ask if youre in a specific room 
		{
			HasControl = false; 
			grav = 0; 
			FallSpeed = 0; 
			onground = true
			sprite_index =  global.SpriteList[global.CurrentSprite].IdleSprite; 
		}
didnt seem to do anything. Maybe I can just put a floor there and he will stand? 
gtg for now, other sprites and details added are in the commit on GitHub
